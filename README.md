This extension allows canceling pending transactions on Etherscan.

Etherscan provides the ability to explore different data from Ethereum blockchain. User has the possibility to check all transactions and many different things which are related to smart contracts, event, blocks, etc. Etherscan is a good tool.

In case if a user made a mistake and sets small fee, he can wait days until the transaction will be canceled automatically or mined, that is why it is good to have a tool which allows canceling transaction with an underpriced fee, which was stuck in a pool. This extension allows canceling pending transactions.
